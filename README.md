Welcome to VisitMeet. A new way to travel in cheap way.

How it works?

A is a traveller who wants to travel world, doing it in least expensive
way, while also helping people wherever A travels.

A just arrived in Nepal and wants to travel the country.
B is member of visitmeet and posts for fooding, lodging and traveling.
Yes, B provides transportation for a traveller so they too can travel.
A likes what B is offering, and purchases their offering(s).
B also knows C who owns and rents rooms in local homes and arranges the trip.
C purchases services of those C knows who are local and happy to do business.
C and B both are exchanging and bartering and selling and buying in their local economy.
A traveled safely with new friends, spending less money.
A and B visit local everything, as B and C know how to provide a joyful visit.
A purchases from local economy, experiencing the real deal with real people.

Note: If you visit KathyOnu in Eugene, Oregon, you will be walking the streets with a saint in the know.
People know their own local best deals, you will experience this as VisitMeet.org builds its connections.
Those connections will first come from the programmers building this site, and their friends.
This is the wave of the future for a long time .. 
Stellar programmers plant seeds of peaceful exchanges.
